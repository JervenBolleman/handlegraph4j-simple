# handlegraph4j simple

An very simple implementation of the interface's in java following the [libhandlegraph](https://github.com/vgteam/libhandlegraph) code.

That library defines a set of interfaces for "Handle Graphs": genome variation graphs where all access to the graphs is mediated by opaque "handle" objects.

This is an implementation with in memory datastructures with some optimizations but nothing spectatcular. It's existence is just to be able to test the bindings to other implementations and for me too play with.
